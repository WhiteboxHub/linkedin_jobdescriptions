For Almost 14 years Synergisticit has helped Jobseekers get employed in the tech Job market by providing candidates the requisite skills, experience and technical competence to outperform at interviews and at clients.

The Job market is Hyper Competitive. For 1 position maybe 500-1000 candidates or more are applying and even experience candidates are taking entry level Job positions due to recent layoffs.

If you apply to 20 positions each day with no result, are not getting interviews or are ghosted by clients then maybe rethink your strategy.

School Projects or experience is not enough anymore. For Entry Level positions also Candidates need to have Projects with the in demand skills which Clients require to get Interviews and finally a Job Offer

In this market also our candidates are able to achieve multiple job offers and $100k + salaries once they have the required skills..
