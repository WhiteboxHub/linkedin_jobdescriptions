About the job
HP is the original Silicon Valley garage company, where two engineers started a global revolution in technology and innovation. Today, HP is going back to its roots with 367 Garage, a new incubation group leveraging GenAI to create new product categories and the future of compute.

367 Garage operates as a startup incubator within HP, giving its teams the autonomy, resources, and support to explore, experiment, and execute on their ideas, while leveraging HP’s scale of execution and distribution. 367 Garage creates products and businesses across consumer and enterprise markets, with a focus on the intersection of hardware and AI.

The name 367 Garage reflects HP's history and vision. 367 Addison Avenue is the address of the famous garage where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in 1939. The garage is now a historic landmark and a symbol of HP's culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. By naming its incubation group 367 Garage, HP honors its past and looks forward to its future, where GenAI will enable new possibilities and experiences for people and businesses around the world.
