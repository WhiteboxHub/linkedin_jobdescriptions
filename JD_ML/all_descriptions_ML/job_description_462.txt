Members can play, pause, and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time. In this role, you will dive into different regions and countries to holistically answer questions like “Who are our members?”, “How satisfied are current members with our service?” and “How do the needs and expectations of non-members differ from those of members?” The questions you answer will help shape how senior leadership thinks about opportunities and challenges in these different regions, and enable us to evaluate and determine how our country-level strategies are performing. As a Senior Analytics Engineer, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining data pipelines, conducting in-depth analyses, and developing tools and products to create a single source of truth around Netflix's greatest consumer-facing opportunities and challenges—at both a company and country level. The ideal candidate will excel in data analytics, storytelling with data, cross-functional collaboration, clear communication with executive stakeholders, and share a passion for continuously improving the way we use data to make Netflix better.
