The Team 

The Defined Benefit organization provides companies with the expertise and convenience of a single provider to administer their DB plans which promises to pay specified pension payment, lump-sum or combination thereof on benefits to participants at retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.
