About the job
WHO WE ARE:

Fiercely independent. Passionately creative. Fueled by data.

Ayzenberg Group, based in Pasadena, CA, is one of the largest, privately held advertising and media companies on the West Coast. A culture of curiosity, we're filled with player/coaches who care about the work from the top down, and team members with an entrepreneurial mindset. We are an equal opportunity employer.

"Okay, nice jargon, but what does that actually mean?" Good question.

Basically, we believe we can do the best work possible, while still being kind and respectful to everyone involved.

We strive to macro (not micro) manage and give all team members the support and freedom they need to thrive—both professionally and personally.

In a nutshell, whether you're a client or a team member, we want you to love it here.
