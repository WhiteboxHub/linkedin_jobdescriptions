About the job
Position Description: Empirico, a biotechnology company that combines unmatched expertise in human genetics-driven target discovery with world-class capabilities in siRNA drug discovery, is looking for a talented data scientist experienced in human genetics and bioinformatics who is interested in applying these skills towards interpreting large scale human genetics data for the purpose of therapeutic target discovery. This is an excellent opportunity for a highly-motivated, creative data scientist to be a vital member of a team of experts dedicated to identifying new therapeutic targets and translating those insights into drug discovery and development programs. Responsibilities:

Your responsibilities will primarily consist of performing analyses and building robust computational pipelines and tools critical to Empirico’s target discovery efforts. You will be expected to –
Collaborate closely with a multidisciplinary team consisting of human geneticists, biologists, bioinformatics scientists and software engineers, and use your data analysis skills to gain insights from massive genetic datasets
Work independently and as part of a team to complete projects related to:
Deploying robust, scalable data analysis pipelines, software tools, and web applications to support target discovery – including innovative methods to analyze genetic and phenotypic data
Implementing cutting-edge analytical methods and algorithms (both internally-developed and those described in the literature)
Integrating, analyzing and visualizing large, complex data sets to extract information useful to our target discovery efforts
Perform focused genetic analyses to gain insights into novel target biology and clearly communicate these analyses to Empirico colleagues
Perform analyses to address critical platform/application QC


Requirements:

This position requires a MS or PhD in bioinformatics or a related discipline (e.g. computer science)
Core background MUST be in data science or bioinformatics; this position is NOT for scientists with a primarily wet-lab background
Strong skills in at least one programming language (preferably Python)
Familiarity with Linux command-line based tools and bash scripting
Experience using HPC/cloud computing environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Demonstrated experience processing, analyzing, and visualizing genetic datasets to make scientific insights
A strong understanding of applied statistical methods and the principles of statistical genetics
Experience working with RNA-seq (or scRNA-seq), GWAS data, and other omics data types a plus
Experience working with UK Biobank data or other large-scale biomedical databases a plus
Full stack development experience a plus, but not expected
Comfortable with version control systems such as Git
Demonstrated ability for writing readable, testable, and SOLID code
Applicants must have authorization to work in the U.S


The estimated base salary range for this role is $80,000 to $150,000.
