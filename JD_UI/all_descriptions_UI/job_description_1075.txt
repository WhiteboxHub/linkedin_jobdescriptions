The Role in a Nutshell

We need a capable web developer skilled in modern WordPress development, particularly native block development using React, to join the team reshaping the public face of WP Engine. This developer will work with other developers, designers, and partners across our Marketing department to build the high-traffic, high-performance, high-visibility sites we are responsible for, running on both headless and traditional WordPress. If that kind of responsibility and technology is appealing, read on!

What's Cool About This Job

Web Developers in WP Engine's Marketing department work remotely for a well-known, growing WordPress company. They use some of the very latest technologies in a friendly and supportive team of expert developers. The development team works alongside our internal partners to build our company's public presence. We also support our company internally by sharing our expertise and knowledge with other parts of the business. We are working to improve our sites and technology because we believe "Design Matters" and that we should be "Built for Growth" (check out the “Core Values” section of wpengine.com/careers!).

We are constantly improving our web experience, from our primary website (a headless WordPress application built on top of the WP Engine Atlas platform) to our other sister sites using traditional WordPress. To succeed, we need a skilled developer who can start contributing quickly. A strong understanding of WordPress is essential; experience with React—particularly within the WordPress context—is needed. Familiarity with Next.js and GraphQL will be helpful. Bonus points for strengths in some of the following: testing, automation, CI/CD, continuous improvement, accessibility, other headless frameworks, API development, and SEO.
